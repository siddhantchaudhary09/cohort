# DOM

- Document Object Model
- we can change HTML dynamically by javascript
- js - browser and Node(Outside)
- window is basically a Global Object.
- window object allows you to interact with browser window
- window is not a part of JS engine . it is a part of browser

## EventListeners

- Suppose we want to do many things on a single action so will you attach multiple functions on onclick ??

- here we will use Event-Listeners

- types of events : double scroll , drag-drop , keypress etc
